<h1>Protocol for RNA extraction</h1>
<h2>Materials and methods<h2>
<h3>You will need</h3>
<ul>
  <li>At least least 50,000 cells according to the original NEBnext RNA-seq library prep kit</li>
  <li>Trizol</li>
  <li>Chloroform</li>
  <li>Molecular grade ethanol</li>
  <li>Machery Nagel RNA XS clean up kit</li>
  <li>Molecular grade water</li> 
</ul>

<p>The procedure couples the extraction of crude RNA/ DNA from a phenol/ chloroform extraction (Trizol) and cleans up the reaction using a Machery Nagel kit.</p>

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<h3>Date performed..............................................................................................................................................<input type='checkbox'></h3>
<ol>
  <li>Resuspend the frozen pellet in 500uL Trizol (depending on cell number). Pipette up and down and incubate for 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add 1/5th volume of chloroform. ie 100uL. Shake vigourously and incubate for 3 min at room temp.</li>
  <li>Spin for 15 minutes at maximum speed. The upper phase (RNA) is about 50% of the volume.</li>
  <li>Remove the aqueous phase of the sample by angling the tube at 45° and pipetting the solution out. 
  <b>Avoid drawing any of the interphase or organic layer into the pipette</b> when removing the aqueous phase.</li>
  <li>DNase treatment of the crude lysate</li>
  <ul>
  	<li>Prepare enzyme-buffer premix: Add 3 μL rDNase to 27 μL Reaction Buffer for rDNase <b>per sample</b>.</li>
  	<li>Add 1/10 volume of enzyme-buffer premix to the crude RNA extract (e.g. to 300 μL RNA extract add 30 μL of the premix comprising buffer and enzyme).</li>
  	<li>Incubate for 10 min at 37 °C</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Add 1 volume of buffer RCU (330uL) from the RNA XS clean up kit</li>
  <li>Load the RNA XS column twice with 315uL of extract to avoid overloading the column.</li>
  <li>Wash with 400uL of buffer RA3, spin and then a second wash with 200uL of RA3.</li>
  <li>Elute with the maximum of 30uL of distilled water provided in the kit.</li>
  <li>Make a <b>1:5 dilution</b> and quantify using the Qubit in DNA extraction lab of CTP lab.</li>
  <li>Use the diluted sample for a RNA pico bioanalyser run in the range of 200 - 5000pg/uL.</li>
</ol>
<p>Recommended amount of total RNA for the next step 100ng - 1ug. A lower limit of 200ng RNA is advised.</p>


<h2>mRNA purification</h2>
<h3>Date performed..............................................................................................................................................<input type='checkbox'></h3>
<p>Use the NEB mRNA magnetic isolation module and start with protocol (A) of the NEBnext mRNA ultra directional kit manual.</p> 
<ol>
  <li>Prepare the first strand synthesis buffer and store on ice during the mRNA purification.</li>
  <li>Dilute the total RNA with nuclease-free water to a final volume of 50 μl in a nuclease-free 0.2 ml PCR tube and keep on ice.</li>
  <li>Prepare the oligo-dT beads</li>
  <ul>
	  <li>Aliquot 15 μl of NEBNext Oligo d(t)25 beads into a nuclease-free 0.2 ml PCR tube.</li>
	  <li>Wash the beads by adding 100 μl of 2x RNA Binding Buffer to the beads. Pipette the entire volume up and down 6 times to mix thoroughly.</li>
	  <li>Place the tubes on the magnetic rack at room temperature for 2 minutes. </li>
	  <li>Remove and discard all of the supernatant from the tube. take care not to disturb the beads.</li>
	  <li>Remove the tubes from the magnetic rack.</li>
  	  <li>Repeat the wash step.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Resuspend the beads in 50 μl of 2x RNA binding Buffer and add the 50 μl of total RNA sample from step 1.</li>
  <li>Place the tube on a thermal cycler and close the lid. Heat the sample at 65°C for 5 minutes and hold at 4°C.</li>
  <li>Remove the tube from the thermal cycler when the temperature reaches 4°C.<li>
  <li>Place the tube on the bench and incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes to allow the mRNA to bind to the beads.</li>
  <li>Place the tube on the magnetic rack at room temperature for 2 minutes to separate the poly-A mRNA bound to the beads from the solution.</li>
  <li>Remove and discard all of the supernatant. take care not to disturb the beads.</li>
  <li>Remove the tube from the magnetic rack and wash the beads by adding 200 μl of Wash Buffer to the tube to remove unbound RNA, mix thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Place the tube on the magnetic rack at room temperature for 2 minutes then Remove and discard all of the supernatant from the tube.</li>
  <li>Remove the tube from the magnetic rack and repeat the wash.</li>
  <li>Add 50 μl of elution buffer to each tube. Gently pipette the entire volume up and down 6 times to mix thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Place the tube on the thermal cycler. Close the lid and heat the samples at 80°C for 2 minutes, then hold at 25°C to elute the Poly-A mRNA from the beads.</li>
  <li>Remove the tube from the thermal cycler when the temperature reaches 25°C.</li>
</ol>
