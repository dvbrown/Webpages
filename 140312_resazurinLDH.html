<h1>Cell proliferation by Resazurin or LDH</h1>
<p>Resazurin a fluorescent dye that detects cellular metabolic activity. 
The blue nonfluorescent resazurin reagent is reduced to highly fluorescent resorufin by dehydrogenase enzymes 
in metabolically active cells. This conversion only occurs in viable cells and thus, the amount of resorufin 
produced is proportional to the number of viable cells in the sample. The resorufin formed in the assay can 
be quantified by measuring the relative fluorescence units (RFU) using a fluorometer (Ex=530-570 nm, Em=590-620 nm).</p>

<p>Legend has it that the compound was initially marketed under the name "Alamar Blue" by invitrogen (now life tech). 
A disgruntled employee leaked the recipe and you can now make the solution yourself for 1/50th the price.</p>

<h2>Materials</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Standard tissue culture supplies</li>
    <li>Fluorescence (preferable) or absorbance plate reader.</li>
    <li>96 well ultra low adherence plates: Ex = 530–570 nm, Em = 590–620 nm</li>
    <li>Resazurin</li>
</ul>

<h2>96 well template</h2>
<p>The 96 well template is here: <a href="96wellplate.xlsx">96 well template</a></br>
Make sure you save as!</p>
   
<h2>Preparation of a single cell suspension and seeding the cells</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Refer to the protocol for glioma stem cell culture to generate a single cell suspension: <a href="glioma-stem-cell-culture.html">Gliomasphere culture protocol</a>   
	</li>
	<li>The initial cell number to be seeded needs to be optimised. Try cells in the thousands to start.</li>
	<li>The cells may be dropped in during flow cytometry eg to compare the proliferation of 2,000 CD133- and CD133+ cells.</li>
	<li>After plating cells in 96 well low adherence plate, wait 2 - 3 days for sphere formation to occur.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Performing the resazurin assay</h2>
<p>Resazurin reagent can detect as few as 50 cells per well in a 96 well plate.
Cells were then treated with reagent and the fluorescence measured 40 minutes and 18 hours later. 
After 40 minutes the fluorescence intensity of alamarBlue® reagent is directly proportional to cell number in 
the range of 500-50,000 cells. Further incubation with reagent (18 hrs) leads to more sensitive 
detection in the range of 50-5,000 cells per well.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Thaw out Resazurin solution (if kept frozen) and warm it to 37°C to ensure all components are completely in solution.</li>
    <li>Plate cells in 96-well plate. Typical seed cell number is 2,000 - 200,000 cells/well depending on cell growth rate.</li>
    <li><b>Cell number titration is recommended to determine the optimal cell seeding density.</b></li>
    <li>Incubate cells with compound of interest for desired period of time (1–72 hr). <b>Make sure all the wells contain the same volume of medium.</b></li>
    <li>Add Resazurin solution to plate (10% - 20% of the initial volume in the well). For example, for plates containing 100 μl medium/well, add 10 μl resazurin solution to each well.</li>
    <li>Incubate the plate for 1–6 hr in standard culture conditions. Incubation time depends on cell type and cell number. 
    The plate can be read multiple times to determine the optimal time point.</li>
    <li>Measure the relative fluorescent units (RFU) using a plate reader. Ex = 530–570 nm, Em = 590–620 nm.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Trying to change media</h3>
<p>At least for neurospheres, most protocols suggest changing media by pipette.</br>
Changing media is necessary if you want to make a resazurin measurement the next day.
I took out 40uL out of the 50uL and added 50uL new media.</p>

<h3>Using the Enspire plate reader</h3>
<p>This plate reader is located on level 5 in the office with the post-docs.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Check to see if there is a blue light coming out of the back of the machine. Then turn the machine on using the switch nearest to you</li>
	<li>Log into the Windows Vista <small><i>(yowser)</i></small> machine. This computer is networked</li>
	<li>Find the Enspire program icon and launch it.</li>
	<li>Go to run protocol -> Resazurin</li>
	<li>In the topright panel of the program click "load". The arm should come for you to load your plate</li>
	<li>Click "run" and then export your data as an excel file.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Performing the LDH <i>plus</i> assay <small>(Roche)</small></h2>

<p>The culture is incubated with the Catalyst and Dye substrate mixture from the kit. For
total cell number counting, the lysis solution is added prior to the substrate reaction.
After the reaction, the assay can be terminated by adding the Stop Solution (optimal).
The LDH activity is determined by a coupled enzymatic reaction, whereby the tetrazolium
salt INT is reduced to formazan. The formazan dye formed is water soluble and
shows a broad absorption maximum at approximately 500 nm.</p>
<p>The datasheet claims to detect less than 100 lysed cells in a 96-well plate</br>
To use the LDH kit to measure cell proliferation the high and low control are not necessary.</br>
Have the following kit contents ready:</p>
<ul>
	<li style="color:#0000FF;">Catalyst</li>
	<li style="color:#FF0000;">Dye solution</li>
	<li>Lysis solution</li>
	<li style="color:#00FF00;">Stop solution</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prepare the working solutions.</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Make up the lysophilate in 1mL of distilled water and let dissolve for 10 minutes. Mix throughly before use.</li>
	<li>Make up the reaction mixture. eg for 100 tests mix 250uL of reconstituted bottle 1 with 11.25mL bottle 2. Mix well.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you are measuring proliferation make sure you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A background control (medium only).</li>
<li>A substance control (max dose of compound).</li>
<li>A substance control that also has the LDH standard solution.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>Add 5uL of the lysis solution to each well. Incubate 15 minutes</li>
	<li>Add 50uL reaction mixture (freshly made up) to each well and incubate for up to 30min at room temp.</br>
	This step is light sensitive so cover with foil.</li>
	<li>Add 25uL of the stop solution and shake the plate for 10 seconds</li>
	<li>Measure the absorbance of the samples at 190 - 492nm. The reference wavelength should be 600nm.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note if you observe crystals in bottle 2, shake the bottle for at least 1 hour at 37 C</p>
