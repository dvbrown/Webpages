<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
	<li>HBSS media. Some people use artificial CSF solution.</li>
	<li>Cell dissociation reagent: Liberase</li>
	<li>Ammonium chloride solution to lyse erytrocytes.</li>
	<li>Scissors, forceps, razors to mince tissues. These are in the animal surgery room in a box marked "Morokoff"</li>
	<li>Liquid nitrogen (or dry ice) in an esky for snap and OCT freezing. The dry ice is in a box on level 5. The code is the same as tissue culture</li>
	<li>Isopentane for OCT freezing</li>
	<li>4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for FFPE fixation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>Maintaining viability is essential to get a reasonable number of cells for experiments at the end. Especially when considering the stem cell fraction will be low</p>

<h3>Dissection of the mouse. <i><small>To be done in the animal house, surgical room.</i></small></h3>
<p>The tumours will be growing in nude mice.</p>
  <ol> <b>Parameters to be recorded for mice</b>

      </ol>
  </ul>
  
<!--< li>Cut off the mouse's head and place the entire cranium in a petri dish filled with PBS. Using forceps to hold the head in place, cut around the central axis of the skull and remove the top of the skull like an eggshell.</li> -->
	  <li>Leave the mouse head attached to the body with the mouse belly down. Hold the skull angled down and make an incision at the base of the skull. Cut vertically until you get to the front. You should then be able to split the skull down the middle by making small cuts.</li>
	  <li>Cut the bottom of the brain stem, trim the optic nerves and scoop the entire brain out and put into a petri dish filled with HBSS.</li>
	  <li>After signing out the mouse and recording the number on the cage card, the brain is able to be transported to tissue culture room</li>
	</ol>


<h3>Collection of brain tissue for histology and RNA/ DNA banking</h3>
<p>For this experiment we wish to collect tissue for histology. Due to the gelatinous nature of the brain, the animal must be perfused beforehand with PFA. <b>Therefore a separate mouse will dedicated to histology</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Formalin fixation</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Protocol for perfusion with PFA. <small>To be done by Steph or Teddy</small></li>
        <li>Cut 2 - 3 mm thick tissue slices for both methods of preservation.</li>
        <li>Fix for a maximum of 24 hours in PFA. The transfer to 70% ethanol for longer term storage prior to processing.</li>
      </ol> </br>
    
    <li>OCT embedding</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Use the plastic cryomoulds from Theo's lab/li>
        <li>Add a little OCT to bottom of the mould. </li>
        <li>Blot tissue before freezing to prevent ice crystals.</li>
        <li>Then put in tissue, <b>interesting side down</b>. Therefore the interesting side will be cut first.</li>
        <li>Fill the mould completely with OCT</li>
        <li>Minimise bubbles.</li>
        <li>Float the mould on top of isopentane which is immersed in liquid nitrogen/ dry ice until the OCT turns from clear to white</li>
      </ol></br>
    
    <li>Flash freezing tissue with liquid nitrogen.</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Take a piece of tissue and place in a labeled 1.5mL and freeze</li>
      </ol> 
  </ul></br>
  

<h3>Minicing and digestion of the brain tumour</h3>
<p>The majority of the protocol is from Venugopal et al "Processing of Primary Brain Tumor Tissue for Stem Cell Assays and Flow Sorting" 2012 Jove <a href="http://www.jove.com/video/4111">Processing of Primary Brain Tumor Tissue</a> with some alterations. 

Patchinson et al "Optimized flow cytometric analysis of central nervous system tissue reveals novel functional relationships among cells expressing CD133, CD15, and CD24." Stem Cells was also consulted <a href="http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfr">Patchinson et al</a></p>

<ol>
	<li>Add 200 μl thawed Liberase <small>(200 μg/mL = 0.62 WU/mL)</small> (Roche Applied Science) to 15 ml of 1x HBSS and place into 37 °C water bath. 			  
	Unlike Trypsin-EDTA, the Liberase method preserves the surface antigen CD133. For a tissue sample of about 0.5 cm3, we use 200 μl of Liberase. If the tissue is smaller, we use 100 ul.</li>
	
	<li>Bring ammonium chloride solution (Stem cell technologies) to room temperature. Ammonium Chloride solution gently lyses red blood cells with minimal effect on other cells. It does not contain a fixative.</li>
	
	<li>In a <b>sterile biological safety cabinet</b>, add 5 ml of aCSF to specimen container, swirl to rinse tissue, then pipette off. This step helps to remove red blood cells (RBC).</li>
	
	<li>Transfer brain tumor tissue to a sterile 100 mm Petri dish.
	Gently mince human tumor tissue with a scalpel to a slurry consistency.</li>
	
	<li>Collect sample using a 10 ml regular pipette or forceps and transfer fragments into the tube containing pre-warmed aCSF with Liberase. Place in 37 °C waterbath, for <b>30 - 90min</b>, mixing every 5 - 10 min with a p1000 pipette.</br>
	After each tituration wait 5min for the tissue to settle and take the top 1mL of solution <small>(floating cells)</small> to avoid disturbing them store these cells on ice to preserve viability.</li>
	
	<li>For preparations with poor viability treat cells for 15 to 30 minutes in a solution of 100 µg/mL DNAse and 5 mM MgCl2 in HBSS at room temperature.
	The FACS buffer <b>cannot</b> contain EDTA in this instance.</li>
	
	<li>Filter the tissue lysate through 70 μm cell strainer into a 50 ml Falcon tube. 
	Spin the filtrate down at 300 x g for 5 min. The percoll can be washed by resuspending in HBSS and spinning 200 × g for 5 min</li>
	
	<li>After accutase dissociation, resuspend cells in 30% Stock Isotonic Percoll (SIP) solution/ 70% 1x HBSS and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 700 g at <b>room temperature</b>.</br>
	This protocol was obtained from Nikodemova et al 2012; J Neuroinflammation. <i>Use plastic pipettes as percoll adheres to glass</i>.</li>
	
	<li>Remove supernatant carefully and evaluate size and colour of the resulting cell pellet: pellets which are pink or red indicate increasing numbers of red blood cells.</br>
	Resuspend pellet in 1 ml PBS. Add an appropriate amount of ammonium chloride solution (4-12 ml) based on pellet size and red cell contamination 	
	<small>(the ammonium chloride solution is very gentle and increased amounts are not harmful to cells other than red cells)</small>.</li>

	</li>Incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Spin cells down at 300 x g for 5 min and wash once with 10 ml of FACS buffer</li>
	<li>Proceed to FACS staining.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Myelin removal by percoll</h3>
<p> In order to use Percoll to prepare a gradient, the osmolality of Percoll (undiluted) must first
be adjusted with saline or cell culture medium to make Percoll isotonic with physiological
salt solutions. Adding 9 parts (v/v) of Percoll to 1 part 10× HBSS is a simple way of preparing a Stock Isotonic Percoll (SIP) solution.</p>

<h3>Antibody labelling for FACS</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Spin down at 500xg at 4°C for 5 minutes.</li>
    
    <li>Resuspend in 90uL <i>for 100uL final vol</i></li>
    <li>Add 5uL of CD133-APC and 5uL of CD44-FITC to samples. For the <b>control</b> samples, add 5uL of isotype-APC.</li>
    <li>Be sure to run the PI only, CD133-APC only and CD44-FITC only controls and ensure proper compensation.</li
    <li>Incubate for <b>20 minutes</b> in the dark in the fridge (dark).</li>
    <li>Wash with 1mL of FACS buffer and centrifuge for 500xg at 4°C for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Resuspend in a sufficient amount <b>minimum 500uL</b> of FACS buffer for FACS sorting. Aim for 5 - 10 million cells per mL.</li>
    <li>Before sorting add 1:100 of 1mg/mL (final 1ug/mL) PI to each tube. This is 5uL of Iwan's buffer for 500uL cells.</li>
    <li>Collect 5 different populations {(CD133+, CD44+). (CD133+, CD44-), (CD133-, CD44+), (CD133-, CD44-)} and <b>mixed population</b>.</li>
</ol>
	
<p>Fluorescence compensation is the mathematical subtraction of the fluorescence due to one fluorochrome from the fluorescence due to another fluorochrome. This is necessary because emission spectra from two fluorochromes can overlap.</p>
