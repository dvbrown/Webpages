<h2>Summary of the student Christmas party survey</h2>
<p>A grand total of 5 people responded to the survey. The identify of participants is anonymous.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The day that was most popular is Thursday 12 December.</li>
  <li>The staff party is on Friday 6 December.</li>
  <li>I <i>Dan Brown</i> won't be here on either date.</li>
  <li>The popular activity was lunch tied with BBQ.</li>
  <li>Since the staff party will likely have a BBQ I suggest lunch near campus somewhere.</li>
  <li>Since I won't be here I don't want to organise the outing.</li>
  <li>Nobody suggested an activity</li>
  <li>4 people were in favour of formalising the club. However we need 10x more people to respond</li>
  <li>I concur with the person who said it was woo much work to formalise the club</li>
</ol>
