<h2>Reverse transcription</h2>

<p>The choice of kit is largely arbitrary. A 1:1 mixture of random hexamer and poly-dT primer covers both mature mRNAs and precursor RNAs. Not all kits give the choice of primer combinations and a primer premix may be the only option.</br>
The amount of RNA you reverse transcribe into cDNA is dependent on the total amount available and the copy number of the target you wish to amplify. 5ng has been quoted as a reasonable amount of cDNA to amplify in a qRT-PCR reaction using a 384 well format. Therefore there will be 5ng cDNA in each 384 well.</br>
For example, working backwards this is 5ng = 1000ng of total RNA input x 1:10 dilution of reverse transcription reaction x 20&#956;L reaction mix volume. If you reverse transcribe less input RNA, then reduce the dilution of the reverse transcription reaction.</br>

<h4>Reverse transcription calculator <small>N.B Dan stills needs to work on his javascript</small></h4>

<h3>Setup of reverse transcription reaction</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Combine the following reagents on ice in 0.2mL PCR tubes</li>
  <ul>
    <li>2x RT reaction mix -> 10uL</li>
    <li>RT Enzyme mix -> 2uL</li>
    <li>Total RNA -> x uL</li>
    <li>DEPC water (included in the kit) -> to 20uL</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>Make an extra reaction for a no template control <small>(make 10uL of it though to save money on reagents)</small></li>
  <li>Optional pre-incubation*</li>
  <li>Mix the contents of the tube and incubate at 50 C for 30 minutes in a thermocycler</li>
  <li>Terminate the reaction at 85 C for 5 minutes and then chill on ice</li>
  <li>Add 1&#956;L of RNase H <b><small>(careful not to contaminate your pipette or bench!)</b></small> incubate at 37 C for 30 minutes</bold></small></li>
  <li>For storage at -20 C it is more convenient to transfer the contents of the 0.2mL tube into a 1.5mL tube as they fit in freezer boxes better. 0.2mL tubes will drop inside the slots and make tube retrieval difficult.</li>
  <li>Store at -20 C and use at the pre-determined dilution in qPCR</li>
</ol>
<p>*<small>(optional) A pre-incubation of RNA and primers at 65 &#8226;C for 10 min enables more efficient priming due to removal of RNA secondary structure. Make sure you include a non transcription control.</br>
ie: include all buffers but not the enzyme.</small></p>

<!-- ################## QPCR SETUP ####################### -->
<page_break> </page_break>

<h2>qRT-PCR reaction</h2>

<p>Before setting up the qRT-PCR reaction <b>plan your 384 well plate</b>. Use the following template <a href="384well_duplicateVersion.xlsx">384 well template</a>
<p>You have the choice of setting up your qPCR reaction manually or using a corbett robot. The Corbett robot has the advantage of being (mostly) mistake-free and you can set up and walk away. The disadvantage is that there is a considerable dead volume and our comparisons have shown manual pipetting to be more reproducible.</br>
The manual setup is somewhat more convenient as you can take your time with the setup. The disadvantage is that is really hurts your hand pipetting and there is the potential for human error. The choice is yours...</p>

<h4>Ideal primer concentration</h4>

<p>The most common concentration for primers is 200 - 1000nM. I prefer a total of <b>400nM</b> or 200nM each <small>(ie forward and reverse primer)</small>.</br>
The working stock concentration of primers is 10uM. Given that the volume of primer + water is 4uL this means you should add 0.2uL of each primer or 0.4uL of a primer mix to 3.6uL of water.
Therefore multiply the amount of primer by the number of replicates +10% to make pipetting volumes easier.</p>

<h2>Manual set up of qRT-PCR</h2>
<h3>Setting up 1.5ml tubes for pipetting</h3>
<p>Note that this setup can be done the day before the qPCR booking and the plate can be stored sealed at 4 C overnight.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Prepare a 1.5mL tube of primer mix for <b>each</b> primer combination. This mix should contain the forward and reverse primer at <b>800nM</b> (2x mixture). The volume should be 5uL per reaction plus pipetting error.</li>
  <li>Prepare a 1.5mL tube of <b>each</b> sample cDNA + SYBR green combination. This mixture should contain 5ng of cDNA per well + 5uL of SYBR green per well plus pipetting error.</li>
  <li>The author finds it easier to pipette the cDNA/ SYBR tubes horizontally such that all wells in the horizontal orientation receive the same solution.</li>
  <li>Take a break and then pipette the primer/ water mixture vertically such that all wells in the vertical orientation receive the same primer. Do not mix wells at this point, just drop the solution in</li>
  <li>Have a rest, then take a 12 well multi-channel pipette and fit all 12 positions with a tip. Hold the multichannel vertically and pipette all wells up and down to mix. Notice that the tip goes in every 2nd slot. Move the pipette to the next column of the plate and also pipette and up and down using the same tip. As you are mixing the duplicates cross-contamination is not an issue.</li>
  <li>Change tips and go back to the first column you pipetted and mix the wells that were missed the first time. Also mix the next column</li>
  <li>Repeat for all columns and take a well deserved break</li>
</ol>

<h3>Set up of your samples on the lightcycler instrument</h3>
<p>Remember to seal the surface of your plate. It is beneficial to pulse spin the 384 well plate to collect all the liquid on the bottom. The plate spinner is in the same lab as the lightcycler.</p>
<ol>  
  <li>Click on the lightcycler icon on the desktop</li>
  <li>The username is "admin" and password is "LightCycler480". <b>Case sensitive</b> Choose GEL DB R database to log on to</li>
  <li>Select the appropriate detection method. I use monocolour hydrolysis probe. Set the plate volume to 10&#956;L</li>
  <li>Include 3 steps</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Preincubation 50 &#8226;C for 2 min.</br>
    <li>95 &#8226;C for 2 min</li>
    <li>Amplification 95 &#8226;C for 15 sec + 60 &#8226;C for 30 sec + 72&#8226;C 30 sec. Acquire at the annealing step.</li>
    <li>A melt curve for SYBR green, continuous measurement. Start at the melting temp then set target to 95&#8226;C.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Press the green start button to begin your run</li>
</ol>

<h2>Export data from the lightcycler</h2>
<p>The Roche software uses the 2nd derivative maximum technique to determine crossing point (threshold). This is the beginning of the log linear portion of the amplification curve.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on analysis tab. Go to create new analysis -> absolute quantification and 2nd derivative.</li>
  <li>You will see the amplification curves. Now set the analysis to high confidence and then click calculate. This takes a few minutes.</li>
  <li>Change to the results panel, select all wells (or just the ones you put sample in) and export the data as a text file (right click - export table)</li>
  <li>If you are not inclined to use plain text files, right click the file -> "open in excel". Once in excel save as an excel spreadsheet.</li>
  <li>Navigate the mouse to the top panel drop down menu. Change analysis to Tm calling. Set to SYBR green I format and click calculate to see the melting curves</li>
  </ol>
  
<h2>Analysis by ddCT method</h2>
<p>The ddCT method is a relative quantification formula that assumes the amplification rate of your templates are equal.</p>
  <ol>
  <li>The author of this document has laboriously written an R library for the analysis of qPCR data. This library takes the raw qPCR data and outputs various QC plots and does all plots and stats testing</li>
  <li>If you are not comfortable with the command line <small>I pity you</small> you can mung the data manually in Excel</li>
  <li>Once the data is prepared in Excel use the <b>ddCt formula</b> <i>2^((houseKeepingX - targetX) - (houseKeepingC - targetC))</i>. X stands for unknown sample and C for Control (calibrator) sample.</li>
    <li>Plot in R or Graphpad Prism <small>because they are much prettier than excel</small></li>
  </ol> 

<!-- ################## ROBOT SETUP ####################### -->
<page_break> </page_break>
<!-- Set up 96 well -->
<h2>Automated (Robotic) setup</h2>

<h3>Set up of your primers on a 96 well plate</h3>
<p>Generally the samples are the primers arrayed in 96 well format, in the case of having few samples and many targets.</br>
However they can be the cDNA/ SYBR green mix, if you have many samples with only a few targets.</br>

<ol>
  <li>Array your primers horizontally on a 96 well plate</li>
  <!--Need to check if the robot pipettes the primers or the SYBR green first -->
  <li>The plating robot can handle replicates but it pipettes from the 96 well plate first <b>after SYBR in the 1.5mL tube</b></li>
  <li>Switch the robot on at the back then click on the short cut to robotics icon (Corbett) on the desktop</li>
  <li>Use a the file DanB_template as a template</li>
  <li>Add your samples to the 96 well plate by clicking its image and selecting "new bank".Then select your wells, type in your sample name, add to selection and click "done"</li>
  <li>As above for your mastermix in the left most panel, representing 1.5mL tubes. Set to aliquot 6&#956;L.</li>
  <li>Now you are ready to set up your 384 well plate. Click on the 384 well image and click "add" on the right panel. From the drop list choose your sample and then the master mix.</br>
  Set the volume dispensed to 4uL and the correct number of replicates <i>(eg 3)</i></li>
  <li>Load <b>50&#956;L</b> tips in the appropriate positions on the deck. Make sure they click into the receptacle. Right click the tip panel and set to "all available tips".</li>
  <li>Press the green arrow to begin the run. You have the option of export the plate map. You will need a USB stick.</br>
  The machine usually makes complaints about the pipetting volume and running out of tips.</li>
</ol>
  <li>The machine will stop if it runs out of tips and you will have to load some more. Click on the appropriate postion in the warning screen to restart the run.</li>
  
  <!-- Set up 384 well -->
<h3>Setting up your 384 well plate map</h3>
<p>The plating robot pipettes the master mix from 1.5mL tubes first in horizontal fashion. Therefore set up horizontal 384 well replicates with the 1.5mL solution as the incremental replicate.</br>
From experience technical replicates have high accuracy so technical duplicates are recommended. Biological triplicates are always necessary for publication.</br>
The robot then adds the 96 well samples in batches of replicates. What this means is the conditions/ combination are changing with each block of replicates <i>(eg primers or cDNA)</i>.</p>

<h4>Set up of tubes of cDNA + SYBR green</h4>
<p>The product from the cDNA synthesis is diluted 10 fold. Therefore if you reverse transcribed 1ug of RNA in 50uL you will
theoretically have 2ng of cDNA per 384 well.</br> Pipette 1uL of this mixture + 5uL of SYBR green mix (per well) 
into a 1.5mL tube. 6uL of this mixture is to be combined with 4uL of the primer mixture described below.
