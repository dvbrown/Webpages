  <h1> Protocol for the culture of Patient Derived Glioblastoma Cells (PDGCs) </h1>
  <p>The cells normally grow as neurospheres in suspension. I typically make 250mL of cell 
  culture media and use the other 250mL as a wash media</p>
  
  <h3> <strong>Materials</strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>DMEM/F12 media with only Pen/Strep = <b>wash media </b> </li>
    <li>DMEM/F12 media with B27, FGF, EGF and Pen/Strep = <b>growth media</b></li>
    <li>40uM cell filter </li>
    <li>6 well Corning ultra-low adherence plates</li>
    <li>B-27 supplement, without vitamin A.</li>
    <li>Human FGF-2</li>
    <li>Human EGF.</li>
    <li>1 x Accutase</li> 
  </ul>
  
  <ol><strong>To reconstitute  EGF and FGF: </strong>
    <li>Both growth factors are used at 10ng/uL final conc </li>
    <li>Make 1mL in sterile deionized water = 100ug/mL</li>
    <li>From this stock solution make 20x 50uL aliquots </li>
    <li>When you are ready to make media dilute 50uL aliquot in 450uL DMEM/F12 + 2% FCS </li>
    <li>Add to media bottle = 1:10,000 from original stock</li>
  </ol>  
  
  <h3><strong> Dissociation of cells: </strong></h3>
  <ol>
  <li>Draw up neurospheres with pipette and dispense into appropriate falcon tube.</li>
  <li>To maximise retrieval of cells pipette 1mL of wash media into empty well and take out remaining cells. </li>
  <li>Spin down tube in centrifuge <b>500 xg, 5min @ room temp</b> </li>
  <li>Aspirate supernatant and resuspend in approx 200uL- 1mL of accutase. TYhe amount of accutase to use is determined by how many cells you have.Incubate at <b>37 degrees for 5 min</b> </li>
  
  <li>Resuspend cells with a 1mL pipette and hold the tube under a microscope at 5x magnification. You should be able to see a cell suspension or clumps of cells. If there are still clumps, return to 37 degrees for an additional 5 min </li>
  <li>For accutase, inactivation is by dilution. Resuspend cells in 10mL of wash media and spin at 500 g.</li>
  <li>Resuspend cells in the appropriate amount of growth media to plate out. If a single cell suspension is required (eg FACS) filter through 40um mesh into a 50mL falcon tube.</li>
  <li>Count cells if appropriate.</li>
  <li>Dilute cells to required volume and plate into 6, 24 or 96 well ultra-low adherence plates </li>
  </ol>
