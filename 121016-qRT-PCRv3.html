<h2>Reverse transcription</h2>
<p>The choice of kit is largely arbitrary. A 1:1 mixture of random hexamer and poly-dT primer covers both bases.</br>
The amount of RNA you reverse transcribe is dependent on the total amount available and the copy number of the target you wish to amplify. 5ng has been quoted as a reasonable amount of RNA to amplify in a reaction.</br>
Working backwards this is 5ng x 1:4 dilution x 20&#956;L reaction mix = 400ng of total RNA. Note quantification is performed on RNA not cDNA.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Combine the following reagents on ice in 0.2mL PCR tubes</li>
  <ul>
    <li>2x RT reaction mix</li>
    <li>RT Enzyme mix</li>
    <li>Total RNA</li>
    <li>DEPC water (included in the kit)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>Mix the contents of the tube and incubate at 50 C for 30 minutes in a thermocycler</li>
  <li>Terminate the reaction at 85 C for 5 minutes and then chill on ice</li>
  <li>Add 1&#956;L of RNase H <b><small>(careful not to contaminate your pipette or bench!)</b></small> incubate at 37 C for 30 minutes</bold></small></li>
  <li>Store at -20 C and use at a 1:4 dilution</li>
</ol>
<p>*<small>A pre-incubation of RNA and primers at 65 &#8226;C for 10 min enables more efficient priming due to removal of RNA secondary structure. Make sure you include a non transcription control.</br>
ie: include all buffers but not the enzyme.</small></p>

<h2>Setting up your 384 well plate map</h2>
<p>The plating robot pipettes the master mix from 1.5mL tubes first in horizontal fashion. Therefore set up horizontal 384 well replicates with the 1.5mL solution as the incremental replicate.</br>
From experience technical replicates have high accuracy so technical duplicates are recommended. Biological triplicates are always necessary for publication.</br>
The robot then adds the 96 well samples in batches of replicates. What this means is the conditions/ combination are changing with each block of replicates <i>(eg primers or cDNA)</i>.</p>

<h4>Set up of tubes of cDNA + SYBR green</h4>
<p>The product from the cDNA synthesis is diluted 10 fold. Therefore if you reverse transcribed 1ug of RNA in 50uL you will
theoretically have 2ng of cDNA per 384 well.</br> Pipette 1uL of this mixture + 5uL of SYBR green mix (per well) 
into a 1.5mL tube. 6uL of this mixture is to be combined with 4uL of the primer mixture described below.
</p>

<h2>Set up of your samples on a 96 well plate</h2>
<p>Generally the samples are the primers arrayed in 96 well format, in the case of having few samples and many targets.</br>
However they can be the cDNA/ SYBR green mix, if you have many samples with only a few targets.</br>

<h4>Ideal primer concentration</h4>

<p>The most common concentration for primers is 200 - 1000nM. I prefer a total of <b>400nM</b> or 200nM each <small>(ie forward and reverse primer)</small>.</p>
<p>The working stock concentration of primers is 10uM. Given that the volume of primer + water is 4uL this means you should add
0.2uL of each primer or 0.4uL of a primer mix to 3.6uL of water.
Therefore multiply the amount of primer by the number of replicates to make pipetting volumes easier.</p>
<!-- Think about a better calculation so you just add 4uL of a pre-diluted mixture -->
<ol>
  <li>Array your primers horizontally on a 96 well plate</li>
  <!--Need to check if the robot pipettes the primers or the SYBR green first -->
  <li>The plating robot can handle replicates but it pipettes from the 96 well plate first <b>after SYBR in the 1.5mL tube</b></li>
  <li>Switch the robot on at the back then click on the short cut to robotics icon (Corbett) on the desktop</li>
  <li>Use a the file DanB_template as a template</li>
  <li>Add your samples to the 96 well plate by clicking its image and selecting "new bank".Then select your wells, type in your sample name, add to selection and click "done"</li>
  <li>As above for your mastermix in the left most panel, representing 1.5mL tubes. Set to aliquot 6&#956;L.</li>
  <li>Now you are ready to set up your 384 well plate. Click on the 384 well image and click "add" on the right panel. From the drop list choose your sample and then the master mix.</br>
  Set the volume dispensed to 4uL and the correct number of replicates <i>(eg 3)</i></li>
  <li>Load <b>50&#956;L</b> tips in the appropriate positions on the deck. Make sure they click into the receptacle. Right click the tip panel and set to "all available tips".</li>
  <li>Press the green arrow to begin the run. You have the option of export the plate map. You will need a USB stick.</br>
  The machine usually makes complaints about the pipetting volume and running out of tips.</li>
</ol>
  <li>The machine will stop if it runs out of tips and you will have to load some more. Click on the appropriate postion in the warning screen to restart the run.</li>
  </br>
  
<h2>Set up of your samples on the lightcycler instrument</h2>
<p>Remember to seal the surface of your plate. It is beneficial to pulse spin the 384 well plate to collect all the liquid on the bottom.</p>
<ol>  
  <li>Click on the lightcycler icon on the desktop</li>
  <li>The username is "admin" and password is "LightCycler480". <b>Case sensitive</b> Choose GEL DB R database to log on to</li>
  <li>Select the appropriate detection method. I use monocolour hydrolysis probe. Set the plate volume to 10&#956;L</li>
  <li>Include 3 steps</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Preincubation 50 &#8226;C for 2 min.</br>
    <li>95 &#8226;C for 2 min</li>
    <li>Amplification 95 &#8226;C for 15 sec + 55 - 65 &#8226;C for 30 sec + 72&#8226;C 30 sec. Acquire at the annealing step.</li>
    <li>A melt curve for SYBR green, continuous measurement. Start at the melting temp then set target to 95&#8226;C.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Press the green start button to begin your run</li>
</ol>

<h2>Export data from the lightcycler</h2>
<p>The Roche software uses the 2nd derivative maximum technique to determine crossing point (threshold). This is the beginning of the log linear portion of the amplification curve.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on analysis tab. Go to create new analysis -> absolute quantification and 2nd derivative.</li>
  <li>You will see the amplification curves. Now set the analysis to high confidence and then click calculate. This takes a few minutes.</li>
  <li>Change to the results panel, select all wells (or just the ones you put sample in) and export the data as a text file (right click - export table)</li>
  <li>If you are not inclined to use plain text files, right click the file -> "open in excel". Once in excel save as an excel spreadsheet.</li>
  <li>Navigate the mouse to the top panel drop down menu. Change analysis to Tm calling. Set to SYBR green I format and click calculate to see the melting curves</li>
  </ol>
  
<h2>Analysis by ddCT method</h2>
<p>The ddCT method is a relative quantification formula that assumes the amplification rate of your templates are equal.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Use the python script 'transposeLinear.py' to convert the 384 well plate map to a linear vector.</li>
    <li>In R import the 384wellLayoutTranspose.txt file and bind it to the transposed sample map using cbind</li>
    <li>Use the custom annotate sample function to annotate the raw Ct file</li>
    <li>Use the split sample name function to split the annotation by whitespace into separate gene and sample factors</li>
    <li>In Excel use the <b>ddCt formula</b> <i>2^((houseKeepingX - targetX) - (houseKeepingC - targetC))</i>. X stands for unknown sample and C for Control sample.</li>
    <li>Plot in R or Graphpad Prism <small>because they are much prettier than excel</small></li>
  </ol>
