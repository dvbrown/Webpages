<h1 align="center">Quantitative reverse transcription PCR</h1>
<p>This method uses SYBR green detection of all double stranded DNA</p>

<h2>You will need:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Anywhere from 10ng to 1&#956;g total RNA</li>
  <li>Reverse transcription kit (first strand synthesis)</li>
  <li>SYBR green mix</li>
  <li>384 well plate for Lightcycler</li>
  <li>96 well <b>(not flat bottom)</b> for samples</li>
  <li>A plating robot</li>
  <li>A lightcycler 480 qPCR machine</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setting up your 384 well plate map</h2>
<p>The plating robot pipettes the SYBR green master mix first in horizontal fashion. Therefore set up horizontal 384 well replicates with the master mix in replicate.</br>
The robot then adds the 96 well samples in batches of replicates. What this means is the samples are changing with each block of replicates <i>(eg triplicate cDNA)</i>.</br>

<h2> Reverse Transcription reaction</h2>
  <p>Make sure you include a non transcription control.</br>
  ie: include all buffers but not the enzyme.</p>
  
<h2>Set up of your samples on a 96 well plate</h2>
<p>Generally the samples are the cDNA templates arrayed in 96 well format.</br>
However they can be the primers if you are doing a titration.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Array your samples horizontally on a 96 well plate</li>
  <li>The plating robot can handle replicates but it pipettes samples <b>after SYBR</b></li>
  <li>Click on the short cut to robotics icon on the desktop</li>
  <li>Use a recent run as a template</li>
  <li>Add your samples to the 96 well plate by clicking its image and selecting "new sample".Then select your wells, type in your sample name, add to selection and click "done"</li>
  <li>As above for your mastermix in the left most panel. Set to aliquot 6&#956;L.</li>
  <li>Now you are ready to set up your 384 well plate. Click on the 384 well image and click "add" on the right panel. From the drop list choose your sample and then the master mix.</br>
  Set the volume dispensed to 4uL and the correct number of replicates <i>(eg 3)</i></li>
  <li>Load <b>50&#956;L</b> tips in the appropriate positions on the deck. Make sure they click into the receptacle. Right click the tip panel and set to "all available tips".</li>
  <li>Press the green arrow to begin the run. You have the option of export the plate map. You will need a USB stick.</li>
</ol>
  <li>The machine will stop if it runs out of tips and you will have to load some more. Click on the appropriate postion in the warning screen to restart the run.</li>
  
<h2>Set up of your samples on the lightcycler instrument</h2>
<p>Remember to seal the surface of your plate</p>
<ol>  
  <li>Click on the lightcycler icon on the desktop</li>
  <li>The username is "admin" and password is "LightCycler480". <b>Case sensitive</b> Choose GEL DB R database to log on to</li>
  <li>Select the appropriate detection method. I use monocolour hydrolysis probe. Set the plate volume to 10&#956;L</li>
  <li>Include 3 steps</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Preincubation 50 &#8226;C for 2 min.</br>
    95 &#8226;C for 2 min</li>
    <li>Amplification 95 &#8226;C for 15 sec then 55 - 65 &#8226;C for 30 sec</li>
    <li>A melt curve for SYBR green</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Press the green start button to begin your run</li>
  <li>Export your data as a spreadsheet and save to a USB stick</li>
</ol>

<h2>Export data from the lightcycler</h2>
<p>The Roche software uses the 2nd derivative maximum technique to determine crossing point (threshold). This is the middle of the log linear portion of the amplification curve.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on analysis tab. Go to create new analysis -> absolute quantification and 2nd derivative.</li>
  <li>You will see the amplification curves. Now set the analysis to high confidence and then click calculate. This takes a few minutes.</li>
  <li>Change to the results panel and export the data as a text file you can open in excel</li>
  <li>Click + to generate a new analysis -> Tm calling. Set to SYBR green I format and click calculate to see the melting curves</li>
